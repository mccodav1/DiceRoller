# DiceRoller

When playing DnD, Magic: The Gathering, or a multitude of other games, it is necessary to roll dice.

Let 'a' represent the number of dice of a given type being rolled, and 'x' represent the number of sides of this dice. 

Then, we can represent a dice roll by the common parlance 'aDx'. Rolling two 6-sided dice may be referred to as "rolling 2d6".

Sometimes, rolling multiple different type of dice is required. This script allows you to do so.
